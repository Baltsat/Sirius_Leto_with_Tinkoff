Everyone knows what a scratch map or erasable maps of the world, as we call them. These maps are sold in paper form, the countries on them are interesting to erase, they look nice on the wall at home. But you can't swipe them, and that's a problem, because the number of countries you've visited is a kind of achievement, which you want to share. Ideally still attach travel notes, photos, add itineraries and insights. And all of this would like to be brought online. So, the product is an erasable map, but not in paper form, but as a website or app. There are few products like this on the market (one site and a few raw apps). Let's try to automatically add some customer trips using geo-positions, and the user will add the desired information. Based on the data obtained about the trips with ml we can build a recommendation system that will help to decide on the next country to spend a vacation.
